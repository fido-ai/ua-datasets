# ua_datasets
__ua_datasets__ is a collection of Ukrainian language datasets. We aim to build a benchmark for research related to 
natural language processing in Ukrainian.

This library is provided by the non-profit student's organization FIdo.ai (machine learning research division of 
[FIdo](https://www.facebook.com/fido.naukma/), National University of Kyiv-Mohyla Academy) for research purposes.

### Installation
The library can be installed from PyPi in your virtual environment (e.g. venv, conda env)
```
pip install ua_datasets
```

### Contribution
In case you are willing to contribute (updating any part of the library, add your dataset) do not hesitate to connect 
through [GitHub Issue](https://github.com/fido-ai/ua-datasets/issues/new/choose). Thanks for your contribution! 
Let's make the Ukrainian language even greater than it is now!
